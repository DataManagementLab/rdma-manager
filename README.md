# RDMA Manager

API for easy RDMA/GPUDirect programming based on the InfiniBandVerbs (IBV) of Mellanox.
Abstracts connection types (reliable/unreliable RDMA) and memory types (main memory, CUDA memory). 
No IBV programming needed as the RDMA manager offers clean and simply functions to abstract away from IBV.

## Testing
The project offers unit tests as well as a tool for performance tests.
